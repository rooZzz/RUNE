## About

**RUNE** is a modified version of the official [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) Android TV client with enhanced UI/UX and additional customization options.

> **Note**: This is an unofficial fork not affiliated with the Jellyfin project. The official Jellyfin Android TV client can be found at [jellyfin/jellyfin-androidtv](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-androidtv).

This project uses the same translation system as the original Jellyfin Android TV client. If you'd like to help, please contribute to the [official Jellyfin Weblate instance](https://translate.jellyfin.org/projects/jellyfin-android/jellyfin-androidtv).
